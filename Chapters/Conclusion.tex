Congratulations! You've completed the Jobseeker's Toolkit. You've no doubt learned a lot about yourself and the types of jobs you want to pursue, as well as how to research jobs and prepare for, and participate in an interview. You have a very robust file system of assignments, contacts, job leads and more. You should be proud of yourself for accomplishing these tasks.
